        //The efficiency of an algorithm depends on the amount of time, storage and other resources required to execute the algorithm.

        //An algorithm may not have the same performance for different types of inputs. With the increase in the input size, the performance will change.
        //The study of change in performance of the algorithm with the change in the order of the input size is defined as asymptotic analysis.

        //Asymptotic notations are the mathematical notations used to describe the running time of an algorithm when the i/p tends towards a particular value or a limiting value.
        //For example: In bubble sort, when the input array is already sorted, the time taken by the algorithm is linear i.e. the best case.
        //But, when the input array is in reverse condition, the algorithm takes the maximum time (quadratic) to sort the elements i.e. the worst case.
        //When the input array is neither sorted nor in reverse order, then it takes average time.
        //These durations are denoted using asymptotic notations.There are mainly three asymptotic notations:
        //Big-O notation: Big-O notation represents the upper bound of the running time of an algorithm. Thus, it gives the worst-case complexity of an algorithm.
        //Omega(Ω) notation: Omega notation represents the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm. Thus, it provides the best case complexity of an algorithm.
        //Theta(Θ) notation: Theta notation encloses the function from above and below. Since it represents the upper and the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm,
        // it is used for analyzing the average-case complexity of an algorithm.
