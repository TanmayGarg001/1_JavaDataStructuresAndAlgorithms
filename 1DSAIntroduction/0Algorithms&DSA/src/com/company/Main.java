        //An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions in sequence to solve a problem.

        //Qualities of Good Algorithms:-
        //Input and output should be defined precisely.
        //Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
        //Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
        //An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.

        //Examples:-
        //Algorithm: Check whether a number is prime or not
        //Step 1: Start
        //Step 2: Declare variables n, i, flag.
        //Step 3: Initialize variables
        //        flag ← 1
        //        i ← 2
        //Step 4: Read n from the user.
        //Step 5: Repeat the steps until i=(n/2)
        //     5.1 If remainder of n÷i equals 0
        //            flag ← 0
        //            Go to step 6
        //     5.2 i ← i+1
        //Step 6: If flag = 0
        //           Display n is not prime
        //        else
        //           Display n is prime
        //Step 7: Stop

        //Algorithm to find the largest among three numbers
        //Algorithm to find all the roots of the quadratic equation
        //Algorithm to find the factorial
        //etc.

        //Programming is all about data structures and algorithms. Data structures are used to hold data while algorithms are used to solve the problem using that data.
        //Two of the most valuable resources for a computer program are time and memory.
        //Example of finding sum of first 10^11 natural numbers, we can write a for loop that we'll take a long ass time which also depends on compiler and system config.
        //But if we use n*(n+1)/2 we get answer in just one instruction.
        //This code executes in just one instruction and gets the task done no matter what the value is. Let it be greater than the total number of atoms in the universe.
        //It will find the result in no time.

        //So number of instructions is directly proportional to the time taken by the code to run.
        //Basically, Time to run code = number of instructions * time to execute each instruction

        //Scalability is scale plus ability, which means the quality of an algorithm/system to handle the problem of larger size.
        //Classroom sample size example.

        //Memory is not always available in abundance. While dealing with code/system which requires you to store or produce a lot of data, it is critical for your algorithm
        //to save the usage of memory wherever possible. For example: While storing data about people, you can save memory by storing only their age not the date of birth.
        //You can always calculate it on the fly using their age and current date.
