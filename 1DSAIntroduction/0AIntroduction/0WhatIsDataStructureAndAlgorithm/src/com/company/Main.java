        //****DATA STRUCTURES INTRO**//
        //A data structure organises and stores the data.
        //There are many different types of data structures and they differ from each other in ways how they organize and store the data.
        //For example :- Arrays order the data sequentially and place each value in a slot.And to access a value we need an index.
        //Whereas in trees(a hierarchical data structure OR abstract data type) they use a notion of parents and children.

        //Now each data structure has strength and weaknesses. Some are good at something and not so good at another thing.
        //There is no SUPER DATA STRUCTURE that does everything well. So we have to learn different types.
        //For example :- Arrays are great for random access if you know the index of item you want to access.
        //Whereas if you don't know the index you have to find the dataset you're looking for.

        //"'it depends' is almost always the right answer in any big question." - Linus Torvalds (invented Linux)
        //So the best data structure to use is :- "It depends" on the data you want to store, how the application we need
        //to access the data, the operations etc etc.
        //So as a developer, you need to decide what to use based on the application needs.
        //Hence the code will be more efficient and perform better and faster.

        //****ALGORITHMS INTRO**//
        //An algorithm is a series of steps you have to perform to accomplish a specific task.
        //For example:- Making a coffee step by step or making a tea step by step.
        //So whilst making coffee one might argue that he/she makes makes coffee in a different way. For example he/she grinds the beans first and then mix them
        //somewhat later in the stage with addition of sugar , whilst other person does this in completely different way. So there are more than one algorithms for
        //accomplishing the same task, which will provide results in a different way.

        //AN ALGORITHM IS NOT AN IMPLEMENTATION i.e. IT DESCRIBES THE STEPS YOU HAVE TO PERFORM, AND IMPLEMENTATION IS THE CODE WE WRITE TO PERFORM THOSE STEPS.
        //So there can be many implementations of the same algorithm.For example while making tea you have to boil water,
        //you may boil water in a pan or over a campfire  or in a saucepan , as long as you are boiling the water you are performing the step.
        //So in the same way when we implement an algorithm it is possible to implement a step in many different ways.

        //So there can be many algorithms that accomplish the same task.
        ///And there can be many implementations of the same algorithms.
