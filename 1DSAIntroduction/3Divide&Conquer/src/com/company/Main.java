        //1. breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems
        //2. solving the sub-problems, and
        //3. combining them to get the desired output.
        //To use the divide and conquer algorithm, recursion is used.

        //How Divide and Conquer Algorithms Work?
        //Here are the steps involved:
        //1.Divide: Divide the given problem into sub-problems using recursion.
        //2.Conquer: Solve the smaller sub-problems recursively. If the sub-problem is small enough, then solve it directly.
        //3.Combine: Combine the solutions of the sub-problems that are part of the recursive process to solve the actual problem.
        //Example:- mergeSort,BinarySort etc.
