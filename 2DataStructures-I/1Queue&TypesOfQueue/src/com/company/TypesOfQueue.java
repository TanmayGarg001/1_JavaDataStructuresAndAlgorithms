        //There are four different types of queues:
        //1.Simple Queue:In a simple queue, insertion takes place at the rear and removal occurs at the front. It strictly follows the FIFO (First in First out) rule.

        //2.Circular Queue:In a circular queue, the last element points to the first element making a circular link.
        //The main advantage of a circular queue over a simple queue is better memory utilization.If the last position is full and the first position is empty,
        //we can insert an element in the first position. This action is not possible in a simple queue.

        //3.Priority Queue:A priority queue is a special type of queue in which each element is associated with a priority and is served according to its priority.
        //If elements with the same priority occur, they are served according to their order in the queue.

        //4.Double Ended Queue:In a double ended queue, insertion and removal of elements can be performed from either from the front or rear.
        //Thus, it does not follow the FIFO (First In First Out) rule.
