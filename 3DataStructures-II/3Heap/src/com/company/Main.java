        //Heap data structure is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property. It is also called as a binary heap.
        //A complete binary tree is a special binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is filled all the nodes are as far left as possible.
        //Before learning this you need to know about trees,So complete the Tree data structure first.
        //ALSO , heap is kind of like a tree, but it is normally(mostly) implemented as an array.
        //By doing this all manually we have to write a fuck-ton of code, there's nothing wrong with it, and it is good for learning purposes but,
        //for time constraints reasons we can build a max/min heap using PriorityQueue class to implement Heaps in Java.
        //By default, Min Heap is implemented by this class. To implement Max Heap, we use Collections.reverseOrder()

        //Maneuver to Heap class to see the heap implementation.
        //Maneuver to Heap2 class to see another heap implementation (fast and preferable).
